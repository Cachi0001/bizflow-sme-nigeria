# Project Implementation Log

This document outlines all the significant changes and implementations made to the Bizflow SME Nigeria project.

## 1. Initial Project Analysis and Setup
- Cloned the GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Cachi0001/bizflow-sme-nigeria.git`
- Performed an initial analysis of the project structure, key files (`README.md`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `package.json`), and overall purpose.
- Generated a comprehensive analysis report (`bizflow-sme-nigeria-analysis.pdf`).

## 2. Core Application Logic Adjustments
- **InvoiceForm.tsx**: Modified to align with new requirements.
- **Clients.tsx**: Modified to align with new requirements.
- **Index.tsx**: Modified to align with new requirements.
- **Referrals.tsx**: Ensured the referral link generation is consistent and not random, based on user ID.
- **TeamManagement.tsx**: Initial modifications for team management functionality.

## 3. Pricing Page Enhancements
- **Pricing.tsx**: 
    - Re-added the 


weekly plan card with its specific features (₦1,400/week, 100 invoices/week, 100 expense records/week, unlimited clients, advanced reporting).
    - Fixed display issues for the weekly plan card.
    - Added the monthly plan card.
    - Updated the yearly plan price to ₦50,000.
    - Modified the FAQ text regarding plan changes to: "Can I change my plan later? Yes, you can upgrade your plan at any time. The changes will take effect immediately."

## 4. Supabase Integration and Backend Functions
- **Supabase CLI Authentication**: Faced and resolved issues with Supabase CLI authentication, eventually using a Personal Access Token (PAT) for successful linking.
- **Supabase Functions Implementation**:
    - Created `supabase/functions/reset-password/index.ts` for password reset functionality.
    - Updated `supabase/functions/process-referral-payment/index.ts` for referral payment processing.
    - Created `supabase/functions/process-withdrawal/index.ts` for handling withdrawal requests.
    - Updated `supabase/functions/handle-upgrade/index.ts` to integrate Paystack for subscription upgrades.
- **Database Migrations and RLS Policies**:
    - Created a SQL migration file `supabase/migrations/20250630_create_withdrawal_requests_table.sql` for the `withdrawal_requests` table.
    - Addressed RLS policy conflicts during `supabase db push` by modifying migration files to explicitly drop and then create policies. (Note: Due to persistent issues, some RLS policy application was advised to be done manually via Supabase dashboard).
    - Ensured the `withdrawal_requests` table exists with 10 columns.
    - Documented the RLS policies for `clients`, `expenses`, `invoices`, `payments`, `referral_earnings`, `referrals`, `subscriptions`, `team_members`, `users`, and `withdrawal_requests` in the `Bizflow-roadmap.md`.

## 5. Salesperson, Referral, and Financial Overview Enhancements
- **Salesperson Account Functionality**:
    - **TeamManagement.tsx**: Modified to include a password field for adding new salespeople. When a salesperson is added, a Supabase Auth user is created with `email_confirm: true` and `user_metadata: { role: 'Salesperson', created_by_admin: true }`.
    - Salespeople created by the admin will need to verify their email before logging in and cannot change their password within the app.
    - Implemented logic to enable/disable salesperson accounts and delete associated Supabase Auth users when a salesperson is removed.
- **Referral Link Display and Messaging**:
    - **Profile.tsx**: Updated to display the referral code and change messaging to "Start Earning" for users with paid subscriptions.
- **Financial Overview**:
    - **Dashboard.tsx**: Adjusted the `YAxis` domain for the financial overview chart to `[0, 'auto']` to ensure more realistic and dynamically scaled numbers based on actual data.
- **Email Verification Flow**:
    - **Register.tsx**: Modified the registration flow. After a user signs up, if their email is not yet confirmed, they are redirected to the login page with a toast message instructing them to verify their email. Users are only navigated to the dashboard if their email is already confirmed.

## 6. Navigation Fixes
- **Pricing.tsx**: Fixed the back button navigation on the pricing page when unauthenticated to redirect to the home page (`/`) instead of the dashboard.
